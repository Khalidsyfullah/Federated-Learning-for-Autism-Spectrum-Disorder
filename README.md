### **Federated Learning for Autism Spectrum Disorder**

This research project focuses on developing a federated learning-based client-server framework for the detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using the Autism Gait and Gesture dataset. The proposed system implements a decentralized and privacy-preserving training environment, ensuring data confidentiality across distributed clients.

### **Project Overview**

Early and accurate detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is essential for timely intervention and better support. Traditional diagnostic methods often face obstacles such as social stigma, limited access to specialists, and challenges in assessing non-verbal individuals. This study proposes a novel federated learning (FL) framework that allows collaborative training of models across decentralized data sources while preserving patient privacy.

The proposed approach integrates three deep learning modelsâ€”Feed Forward Neural Network, Multilayer Perceptron, and LSTM-CNNâ€”to analyze various ASD-related features. The federated model achieved a peak accuracy of **97.5%**, outperforming traditional centralized approaches. This research demonstrates the potential of FL to enhance early ASD detection, offering a secure, inclusive, and scalable diagnostic tool.
